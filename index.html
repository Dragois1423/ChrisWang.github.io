As a crew member, I collaborated with my peers in order to maintain the excellent standards that customers expect. Whether it'd be becoming the cashier, janitor or the cook for the night, I would communicate with my peers to ensure the restaurant not only is sanitary but also feels welcoming for the customers. That is, there was no single task that I was designated to accomplish because my role as a crew member was to identify and assist any area that was lacking. </p>

    <h4 class="actname">Air Cadet</h4>
        <p class="roundGrey">Air Cadet is a youth program whose primary purpose is to develop and nurture teens to becme great and impactful leaders in the future. While in air cadet, I was an instructor for younger cadets known as the "Level 2's". I was responsible of giving either 30 minute or 60 minute lessons every other week. That is, I was responsible for educating them on aerospace material through engaging and interesting activities. And this ultimately required excellent preparation and communication skills on my part, because I had to allocate time away from school towards the construction and rehearsal of my lesson plans prior to the actual teaching day in order to acheive maximum efficiency when presenting.</p>

As captain, I oversaw the whole program and led a group of 9 volunteers to assist children with assignments, studying for tests and reading. What's more, I also devised learning strategies for each children based on their learning capabilities. Ultimately, I had to possess a strong, adaptive ability for unforeseen situations and excellent accountability.</p>

    <h4 class="actname">Summer Camp Assistant</h4>
        <p class="roundGrey">Everyday from 9am to 3pm for two months as the assistant, I was primarily responsible for setting up and leading activities along with the program leaders and to support them whenever required. Because the program leaders had to oversee the entire program, I was essentially the person whom all the children would communicate first, the one closest to them during the camp. My responsibilities also included but not limited to resolving conflicts between children, connecting with their parents and overseeing the children's safety during outdoor excursions. In order to complete all this, I demonstrated superior teamwork prowess and possessed excellent team player qualities.</p>
